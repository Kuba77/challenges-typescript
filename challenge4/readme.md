# Challenge 4 - Difficult (Extra credit)

> today, your challenge is to create a program that will take a series of numbers (5, 3, 15), and find how those numbers can add, subtract, multiply, or divide in various ways to relate to eachother. This string of numbers should result in 5 * 3 = 15, or 15 /3 = 5, or 15/5 = 3. When you are done, test your numbers with the following strings:
> `4, 2, 8`
> `6, 2, 12`
> `6, 2, 3`
> `9, 12, 108`
> `4, 16, 64`
> For extra credit, have the program list all possible combinations.
